The Students HealthConnect web application aims to connect ALU students in Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia with accessible healthcare services. This scope of work streamlines the initial and revised project proposal shared. It creates a more direct solution to the healthcare services received by ALU students who are actively enrolled and are engaged in a hub experience in different parts of Africa.

The platform will be a comprehensive and user-friendly tool, allowing students to access healthcare resources, book appointments, receive health-related information, and connect with qualified medical professionals in a new country. At the same time, they carry out their studies in different Hubs around Africa. The application will focus on promoting students' well-being and addressing their healthcare needs efficiently.
